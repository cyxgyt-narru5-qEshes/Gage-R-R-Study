## Introduction

### What is measurement?

According to (BSI, 1993) examples of measurement can be expressed as:

-   Record of a measured dimension such as length, or diameter.

-   Record of a physical property such as density or speed.

These "records" or measurements using instrumentation can be used
as data to control and monitor products performance by a designer or a
manufacturing engineers.

![Figure 1 - Measuring Instruments across
industries](MDV.jpeg){width="500"}

### What is the impact of poor measurement?

Poor measurement can arise due to:

Human error - employees are not trained properly to take correct
measurements. 

-   Calibration error - a machine or an instrument is not calibrated to
    take correct measurements. 

-   Environmental factors - variations in temperature, humidity or
    vibration between quality control and manufacturing sectors.

There, "poor" or incorrect measurements can directly influence a product
quality or a manufacturing process leading to:

-   Manufacturing products outside of a required tolerance.

-   Misalignment during

-   Increased waste and production costs

-   Customer dissatisfaction

### What are the economics of measurement?

Correct measurements that will result in manufacturing products within a
tolerance zone financially depend on:

-   Employee training and simplification of processes to reduce human
    error.

-   Repeated calibration of measuring instruments and manufacturing
    machinery.

-   Control of temperature and humidity at the manufacturing and quality
    control department.

By controlling these factors reduction in rework, scrap and customer
returns will results in a greater financial return.

### How should measurement instruments be maintained?

According to TRACAL. (n.d.), example of a maintenance of vernier
calipers: 

**Don't:**

Throw or drop calipers. 

Use callipers as a substitute tool (screwdriver). 

Exceed the measuring range of calipers.

**Do:**

Clean the measuring jaws and whole calipers 

Return it into its storage cage 

Regulary calibration by a metrological company or by gauge blocks.

## Gage R&R Overview & Key Terms

Gage R&R refers to the Repeatability and Reproducibility of measuring
methods to find how much is processed out of tolerance due to the wrong
measuring system. (Naomi, 2014)

**Importance of Gage R&R**

As mentioned the R&R study measures the variation in measurements caused
by the measuring itself rather than manufacturing processes which shows
also highlights the precision of a employee measuring methods. This
method is cost effective and time efficient due to firstly focusing on
measuring system's repeatability and reproducibility rather than
optimizing a manufacturing processes and technology (Naomi, 2014).

According to (BSI, 2023) terms below are defined as:

**Repeatability**

Likelihood of repeating the same measurements in a short period using
constant conditions (laboratory, equipment, operator).

**Reproducibility**

Likelihood of obtaining the same measurements using different conditions
((laboratory, equipment, operator).

### What is a Measuring System Analysis

![Figure 3 - Measuring System Analysis (Naomi, 2014)](MSM.png)

As seen in Figure 3 the MSA describes where a variation could occur
during part inspection, measuring and analyzes the overall quality of
this measuring system.

### What are the components of measurement error?

An example from (Naomi, 2014) focuses on measuring 3 different parts by
3 different operators in an arrangement of Operator A measures x,y,z
part and then Operator B measures x,y,z with 4 trails for each part.

This data is then used to calculate the range within all the data falls
and the mean value of the measured dimension of each operator. If all
operators measured data is averaged we can find the measuring system
**repeatability and reproducibility errors**.

If R&R data falls within 10% the measuring system is acceptable. 

![Figure 4 - Acceptable R&R Limits (Naomi, 2014)](RRR.png)

## Methodology

This assignment followed a procedure shown in Figure 5.

The Experiment was carried out in following order:

-   Calibrated vernier calipers

-   Measured length of a screw

-   Recorded measured data into a table

-   Repeated until reaching 10 screws

The crossed R&R method was used as a measuring system as shown in Figure
6.

### How was the data collected for the study?

## Discussion

This whole section is comparing an example of a R&R study used in
(Biz-Pi, 2025) to proof check assignment results.

**Numerical Results**

**Total Gage R&R Contribution**

Represent the percentage contribution of a value which combines the sum
of the overall variation of varying components (Repeatability,
Reproducibility, Operator) and part-to-part variation.

Results found from the numerical solution show a value of Total Gage R&R
contribution of 0.47 while combined with Part to Part 99.53 will result
in a total contribution in variation of 100.

The criteria to have a successful R&R study according to
(Biz-Pi, 2025) is that the Total gage R&R contribution should be below
1%, which in our study was found to be 0.47, which is within the
acceptable limit.

**Several distinct categories**

Represent a value of several groups that can be divided into different
categories.

The more NDCs we have, the more data can be separated from each other. 

The goal is to have more than 10; our study found to have 20, which is
the acceptable limit.

**Graphical Results** **Graph Components of Variation**

A summary of variation, Repeatability, Reproducibility and Part2Part. 

There are two compared results % Contribution % Study Variance (overall
variation).

The %StudyVar was found to be 6.89 which is in the acceptable limit. 

The repeatability and reproducibility are kept low showing no variance
is in these abilities showing a solid measuring system.

**Range Chart by Operator**

Represents a repeatability and reproducibility variation.

All data is in the control limits of each operator resulting in a
repeatable and reproducable measuring system.

**Xbar chart by Operator**

Taking upper and lower control limits from the R chart this graph
represents part variation.

Ideally, all of these points should be very far away from the control
limits.

Meaning that the variation between the parts is easy to detect
neglecting the variation in the measuring system. All of the points
are very far away from control limits in each operator's measurements.

**Length by Part**

Represents readings of each operator. The length variation between parts
differs by 0.5 [mm] which results in a greatspread along a y-axis of
datapoints. 

Data points are close to each other in most samples resulting in a
reading very close to a part average. In
samples 5,7,8 a great difference between the points can be
spotted highlighting that the system is having a hard
time differentiating between an error in measuring the system or a part
itself.

**Length by Operator**

Shows the difference between operators mean length measurements. This
chart should be ideally straight no diffrence between measured mean
length of each operator.

In our scenario a mean length of operator 1 and 3 is very similar while
2 decreases by a slight amount.

**Operator Interaction**

Shows a difference between operators interactions of how they measured
parts length, ideally all operators should measure the length as a same
value. T

he greatest iteraction can be seen at sample size 7 and 8 where operator
1 measured length completely differently than other 2 operators. 

## Conclusions

According to Reference this study shows acceptable limits of:

-   Total Gage R&R Contribution found to be 0.47.

-   Total Gage R&R Variance found to be 6.89.

-   Number of distinct categories found to be 20.

All graphical results shows that this measuring system is highly
repeatable, reproducible.
